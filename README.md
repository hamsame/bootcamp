# bootcamp
Fake Website made for a coding bootcamp built with Materialize CSS.
I made an image slider with html and javascript, created a sidebar with materialize, added hover animations on some elements, created an overlay on the hero section, used css grid, imported icons from line awesome and materialize libaries. I also added Google Maps.
